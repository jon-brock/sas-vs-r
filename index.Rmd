Welcome! This training is intended for those individuals who have experience performing data cleaning and analysis in SAS, but want to learn and develop similar skills in R. Get ready to have fun!

Here are some key things that you need to know about R:  

1. It is an object-oriented environment.  
2. It can be run by itself, but most people use an IDE, such as R Studio, for easier work flows.  
3. It can utilize many different `packages` that contain their own set of functions.  
4. It is open-source and free!

I'm going to teach you to use R based on a "tidy" mindset, as popularized by Hadley Wickham. His book, **R for Data Science**, is an invaluable resource and is also free [online](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). The diagram below illustrates the general work flow for keeping your code tidy.

Let's jump right into it!

## Loading Packages  

First, you'll want to load your required packages for you to do your work. You load your packages individually by using the R function `library()`. To start, we will only use one package: `tidyverse`.

```{r load packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

If you do not have the `tidyverse` package installed, or any other package you may need, you can install the package using the function `install.package()` and typing `"package name"` inside the parentheses. Be sure to include double-quotation marks around the package name.  

The great thing about the `tidyverse` package is that it includes a bundle of eight packages commonly used for data importing, wrangling, and visualizing.  

The eight packages are:  

Package | What it can help you do | Cheatsheets  
--- | --- | :---:  
`ggplot2` | plotting/visualizations | [pdf](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)  
`tibble` | working with tibbles (a type of data frame) | N/A  
`tidyr` | data cleaning | N/A  
`readr` | importing different data types | [pdf](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf)  
`purrr` | iterations and repeated tasks | [pdf](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/purrr.pdf)  
`dplyr` | data cleaning and manipulation | [pdf](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf)  
`stringr` | working with character (or string) variables | [pdf](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/strings.pdf)  
`forcats` | working with factor variables | [pdf](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/factors.pdf)  

There are other cheatsheets available [here](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).  Three other cheatsheets that will be of particular value to you as a new user of R include:  

Package | What it can help you do | Cheatsheets
